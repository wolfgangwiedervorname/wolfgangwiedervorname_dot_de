Schwalbe's new valves were the talk of the show. In fact I cannot recall a single booth being quite as crowded (apart from Cosmic's on wednesday night but they had margaritas and tacos at the time). Apparently they were giving out samples on wednesday but by the time I got there on thursday that practice had been halted, due to overwhelming demand. The good bits of info weren't really at Schwalbe anyhow, it all seemed to get a bit lost in the marketing mishmash, the real scoop was at SKS, their partner for the pump heads.  
So let's run down the observations:

These things work as advertised. Attachment and detachment is a breeze, little to no air loss upon removal, letting air out is much nicer than with than with Schrader valves. In terms of pure function this is a knockout.

You can easily change Presta valves to Clik by swapping the core and vice versa.

Presta pumpheads work with Clik. I was not able to test or get further on this though. How well does it work, will all Presta heads work (think screw-on like with Lezyne)? Time will tell.

Schwalbe has an exclusivity deal on these. *However* this is timed and only for Europe.

SKS will offer pumps for the valves. However there seems to be no sign of multivalve heads so far. If you want to make the most out of the Clik valve you gotta go all in. Friend shows up at your door with a flat? Better have some spare valve cores because you won't be inflating their presta valves with your fancy new clik pump. No word on mini pumps yet, hopefully that becomes a thing soon.
