Hi, welcome to my website, I'm Arno Wolfgang, bicycle mechanic by trade, bicycle salesperson by circumstance.

My core areas of expertise at the moment revolves around what you call Trekking bikes round these parts, hybrid bikes elsewhere, E and non-E. The boring stuff if you will (at least at first glance, they can be plenty interesting). The everyday bikes.

I got my start in the industry in 2014, with an apprenticeship at Velotraum near Stuttgart, eventually finishing in early 2017 at the top of my class. At Velotraum I gained a deep understanding of high-end custom trekking/expedition bikes and a lifelong love for wheel-building.

What followed was a very brief stint as a part-timer at Biketeam Raunheim, a shop local to my parent's area for about half a year, while I passed the time until...

2017-2020 I spent time in Karlsruhe pursuing an engineering degree first at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and then at the Hochschule Karlsruhe, ultimately however fruitless. The biggest takeaway from that time was knowledge of CAD modelling and some sorely needed life experience. While studying I also used said CAD experience to design and sell a custom computer keyboard.

In 2020 I joined Bicibene in Karlsruhe, initially as a mechanic. From there I pivoted to a primarily sales role, with my job in the workshop being more that of a firefighter since. Apart from the day to day bike-selling, I also take part in procurement/preorder business and do some light bikefitting.  
With brands like Velo de Ville, Maxcycles, Columbus and Velotraum in our lineup there is a big focus on custom bikes, which makes for a challenging but also very rewarding sales environment.
