      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two occasions usually bring me to the lands around Münster, both are bikes. I always greatly enjoy my time there, gently rolling hills, red brick houses dotted btween, time seems to pass a hair slower whenever I&amp;rsquo;m there.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Just a bit north of the city is Velo de Ville with their now massive facility, two factory halls, flagship store, offices et cetera. If one takes the train west, coupled with a small bike ride you end up at Maxcycles and their much more humble abode.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;A lot less busy than Velo de Ville, a good chunk lighter, more attention to detail, but also a good chunk more expensive is how I&amp;rsquo;d describe them by comparison.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The time had come again in September for their in-house presentation, so I made a stopover on my way north to a wedding, to gaze at new models, discuss bikes and maybe have a few snacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Eurobike 2024 Part III: Thoughts on the Schwalbe Clik valve and everything else I forgot</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the last part of the eurobike trilogy, all the leftovers, it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a bit long.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Schwalbe&amp;rsquo;s new valves were the talk of the show. In fact I cannot recall a single booth being quite as crowded (apart from Cosmic&amp;rsquo;s on wednesday night but they had margaritas and tacos at the time). Apparently they were giving out samples on wednesday but by the time I got there on thursday that practice had been halted, due to overwhelming demand. The good bits of info weren&amp;rsquo;t really at Schwalbe anyhow, it all seemed to get a bit lost in the marketing mishmash, the real scoop was at SKS, their partner for the pump heads.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;So let&amp;rsquo;s run down the observations:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s summer again and that means the world of cycling congregates in Germany for Eurobike.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The switch from Friedrichshafen to Frankfurt has been very welcome on my end, Lake Constance may be nice but in many regards it was what Berliners call &amp;ldquo;JWD&amp;rdquo; (janz weit draußen, way out). Every year the Lake Constance highway would be inevitably &lt;em&gt;clogged&lt;/em&gt; on sunday night by the collective masses trying to get back to Frankfurt and out of the country.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It thus seemed only prudent to move the show to where everybody wanted to be anyhow.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m staying the full 3 vendor days and figured I might as well add my observations and opinions to the deluge of those already out there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, welcome to my website, I&amp;rsquo;m Arno Wolfgang, bicycle mechanic by trade, bicycle salesperson by circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My core areas of expertise at the moment revolves around what you call Trekking bikes round these parts, hybrid bikes elsewhere, E and non-E. The boring stuff if you will (at least at first glance, they can be plenty interesting). The everyday bikes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I got my start in the industry in 2014, with an apprenticeship at Velotraum near Stuttgart, eventually finishing in early 2017 at the top of my class. At Velotraum I gained a deep understanding of high-end custom trekking/expedition bikes and a lifelong love for wheel-building.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fixing stuck Tektro E9 Shifters</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/240617_fixing_tektro_e9_levers/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In most regards Tektro&amp;rsquo;s first groupset, the E9, has been a mature and excellent product, especially for a company so new to the field of shifting. Well thought out details, a good gearing selection, and shiftfeel that eclipses both the old Shimano Alivio and new CUES U4000 9-speed groupsets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Most&amp;rdquo; however is doing a lot of heavy lifting. People familiar with the groupset may already know what I&amp;rsquo;m alluding to, it&amp;rsquo;s the upshift action. Unlike with Shimano, where the upshift lever works by pull (and push, depending on the model), the Tektro lever is push only. This wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be bad, were it not for the fact that &lt;em&gt;pulling on it can brick the shifter&lt;/em&gt;. The warning sticker is a good idea, however in the hands of customers (and in one instance a mechanic), it has not enjoyed a flawless success rate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Eurobike 2024, Part II: A Blaze in the Northern Sky</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/dorkthrone.png&#34; alt=&#34;The cover of A Blaze in the Northern Sky but Fenriz holds a Briq-XL light&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you ask me, the two European titans of bike lighting right now are Herrmans and Busch&amp;amp;Müller. Both manage to create well designed lights for E-Bikes and dynamos with local production at scale and a pricepoint relevant to OEM use. While other manufacturers are also present in this market, I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed their products the most, at least as far as the mass market is concerned.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Historically Herrmans has been the choice of the more value-minded product manager with Busch&amp;amp;Müller being the more premium choice, offering more well engineered optics and a better build. The past year or so however both companies have made forays into the other&amp;rsquo;s space and the result has been an incredible back and forth with great products releasing left and right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
