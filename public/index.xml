      <description>This is the last part of the eurobike trilogy, all the leftovers, it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a bit long.&#xA;Schwalbe&amp;rsquo;s new valves were the talk of the show. In fact I cannot recall a single booth being quite as crowded (apart from Cosmic&amp;rsquo;s on wednesday night but they had margaritas and tacos at the time). Apparently they were giving out samples on wednesday but by the time I got there on thursday that practice had been halted, due to overwhelming demand.</description>

      <description>If you ask me, the two European titans of bike lighting right now are Herrmans and Busch&amp;amp;Müller. Both manage to create well designed lights for E-Bikes and dynamos with local production at scale and a pricepoint relevant to OE use. While other manufacturers are also present in this market, I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed their products the most, at least as far as the mass market is concerned.&#xA;Historically Herrmans has been the choice of the more value-minded product manager with Busch&amp;amp;Müller being the more premium choice, offering more well engineered optics and a better build.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s summer again and that means the world of cycling congregates in Germany for Eurobike.&#xA;The switch from Friedrichshafen to Frankfurt has been very welcome on my end, Lake Constance may be nice but in many regards it was what Berliners call &amp;ldquo;JWD&amp;rdquo; (janz weit draußen, way out). Every year the Lake Constance highway would be inevitably clogged on sunday night by the collective masses trying to get back to Frankfurt and out of the country.</description>

      <description>Hi, welcome to my website, I&amp;rsquo;m Arno Wolfgang, bicycle mechanic by trade, bicycle salesperson by circumstance.&#xA;My core areas of expertise at the moment revolves around what you call Trekking bikes round these parts, hybrid bikes elsewhere, E and non-E. The boring stuff if you will (at least at first glance, they can be plenty interesting). The everyday bikes.&#xA;I got my start in the industry in 2014, with an apprenticeship at Velotraum near Stuttgart, eventually finishing in early 2017 at the top of my class.</description>

      <title>Fixing stuck Tektro E9 Shifters</title>

      <description>In most regards Tektro&amp;rsquo;s first groupset, the E9, has been a mature and excellent product, especially for a company so new to the field of shifting. Well thought out details, a good gearing selection, and shiftfeel that eclipses both the old Shimano Alivio and new CUES U4000 9-speed groupsets.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Most&amp;rdquo; however is doing a lot of heavy lifting. People familiar with the groupset may already know what I&amp;rsquo;m alluding to, it&amp;rsquo;s the upshift action.</description>
