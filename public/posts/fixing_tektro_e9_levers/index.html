			<p>In most regards Tektro&rsquo;s first groupset, the E9 has been a mature and excellent product especially for a company so new to the field of shifting. Well thought out details, a good gearing selection, and shiftfeel that eclipses both the old Shimano Alivio and new CUES U4000 9-speed groupsets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most&rdquo; however is doing a lot of heavy lifting. People familiar with the groupset may already know what I&rsquo;m alluding to, it&rsquo;s the downshift action. Unlike with Shimano, where the upshift lever works by pull (and push, depending on the model), the Tektro lever is push only. This wouldn&rsquo;t be bad were it not for the fact that <em>pulling on it can brick the shifter</em>. The warning sticker is a good idea, however in the hands of customers (and in one instance a mechanic), it has not enjoyed a flawless success rate.</p>
<p>The lever can be unbricked. It&rsquo;s not an entirely smooth and easy process but once you know <em>how</em> it is not especially daunting. Since I have not found any documentation describing the process, I figured it was high time to do so.</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hex keys, 4, 3 and 1.5mm</li>
<li>A philips Screwdriver</li>
<li>Sidecutters</li>
<li>A new shifting cable</li>
</ul>
<p>Start by cutting the shifting cable at the derailleur. You can then extract it from the housing, just leave it dangle for now. Next loosen the clamp bolt of the shifter and rotate it so the underside faces up. Luckily the shifter can remain on the handlebars for the process. I have bought a demo unit for the purpose, so it will remain on the workbench for the photos.</p>
<p>Remove the barrel adjuster from the housing and put it aside.</p>
<p>Next, open the housing by removing the 3 philips screws. You can slip the lid over the downshift lever and out. Put the lid in the same spot you put the barrel adjuster.</p>
<p>Now you can remove the guts of the shifter. Remove the little rubber cover on the downshift lever and pull the old cable out.</p>
<p>Looking closely, we can see how things have gone awry. To fix the shifter we have to move the post circled back into the groove its supposed to be in. Remove the 1.5mm allen screw.<br>
After that you will be able to carefully lift the post up and move it back into position. Make sure the tension spring stays where it is.</p>
<p>Test the guts for correct function, then shift all the way up into the highest gear.</p>
<p>Reinstall the shifting mechanism and put the lid back on. Thread in a new cable, then close the opening on the downshift lever back up. Next reinstall the cable adjuster. This can also be done before putting the new cable in, but it&rsquo;s less hassle in this order. Reinstall the rubber cover.</p>
<p>Pull the cable through to the derailleur, install as normal and adjust tension as needed, and done.</p>
<p>You can then tell the customer/colleague about your brilliant watchmaker-like skills.</p>
