      <description>If you ask me, the two titans of bike lighting are Herrmans and Busch&amp;amp;Müller. Both manage to create well designed lights for E-Bikes and dynamos with local production at a scale and pricepoint relevant to OE use. While other manufacturers are also relevant in this market, I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed their products the most, at least as far as the mass market is concerned.&#xA;Historically Herrmans has been the choice of the more value-minded product manager with Busch&amp;amp;Müller being the more premium choice, offering more well engineered optics and a better build.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s summer again and that means the world of cycling congregates in Germany for Eurobike.&#xA;The switch from Friedrichshafen to Frankfurt has been very welcome on my end, Lake Constance may be nice but in many regards it was what Berliners call &amp;ldquo;JWD&amp;rdquo; (janz weit draußen, way out). Every year the Lake Constance highway would be inevitably clogged on sunday night by the collective masses trying to get back to Frankfurt and out of the country.</description>

      <description>In most regards Tektro&amp;rsquo;s first groupset, the E9, has been a mature and excellent product, especially for a company so new to the field of shifting. Well thought out details, a good gearing selection, and shiftfeel that eclipses both the old Shimano Alivio and new CUES U4000 9-speed groupsets.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Most&amp;rdquo; however is doing a lot of heavy lifting. People familiar with the groupset may already know what I&amp;rsquo;m alluding to, it&amp;rsquo;s the upshift action.</description>
